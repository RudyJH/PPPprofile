# PPPProfile
Personality and Public Policy Profile tool <br>

The vision in to create a dynamic, self-updating database of public figures including politicians, opinion writers and celebrates. Any public figure that ventures into the set of issues being tracked. Private users can create their own  PPPProfile for comparison, but will not be part of the database {this data would probably be kept in a cookie} 
This project was started in 2001 in response to the 9/11 attack. It is meant to help understand how and why people on all sides {better definition needed} think and act. To bring as many people - that is US citizens - together to vote in a way that serves the Free Market and Self Government that the USA was designed to be. <br>
<br>
There will be several parts of the PPPProfile: <br>
1. Define Terms
1. Top Issues
